# Center
FORTRAN 90

This program can move the coordinates of a system around the center.
This is specially useful for molecules in *.xyx file format.

This is made by calculating the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate and Z-coorinate averages and 
substracting each average on each coordinate from the original data.
New coordinates look like: ((x - X average), (y - Yaverage), (z - Zaverage))

I upload the program and a data example.
