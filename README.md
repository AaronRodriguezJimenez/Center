# Center
FORTRAN 90
For theoretical chemists, and people who is working with CARTESIAN COORDINATES!!!

This program can move the coordinates of a system around the center.
This is specially useful for molecules in *.xyx files that are implied in molecular 
HF, DFT, (and other kind of) calculations.

This is made by calculating the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate and Z-coorinate averages and 
substracting each average on each coordinate from the original data.
New coordinates look like: ((x - X average), (y - Yaverage), (z - Zaverage))

I upload the program and a data example.
